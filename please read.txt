Hi!

I used Selenium IDE for firefox to run the tests.
(I also used Katalon studio to run it on different browsers. 
I can help you set it up if you wish as it is an awesome one click tool.)

Please open the test cases if you wish to run them.
Run them at the following order:
1. Sanity1
2. Functionality
3. Negative

Note - Setting the test above medium speed could cause errors.
Note - Some manual testing was performed (for example in the invalidate button)

The lib folder contains the jar files for eclipse if you want to see the source.
You may need to slow down the webdriver.
If you wish me to slow it down for you it could take time setting the delays so I hope you are ok  with viewing them on the IDE :)

Test protocols with pass and fails are in the test protocol folder.
In the same folder you can find the issues report.

thanks !
